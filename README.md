BookNest LMS - Frontend

BookNest is a full-stack Library Management System developed to streamline and modernise the running of a library. The site enables members to browse and borrow books online, place holds on physical titles, and provide reviews. Library staff have complete control over books, members, borrow records, holds, and reviews. A Super Admin level manages all staff accounts and oversees the overall operation of the system.

Features

Book Catalogue & Search
Search all books on-site in real time using title, author, or keywords. Users can filter by genre, type of edition, and language.

Borrow E-books
Members can self-borrow e-book editions directly. Each member can borrow up to five e-books simultaneously. E-books are automatically returned by the system on the due date.

Hold System
Unavailable physical books can be placed on hold. Holds last for two days and are fulfilled by library staff. Members can have a maximum of three active holds.

Reviews and Ratings
Members can review and rate books after returning them. Reviews require admin approval before becoming publicly visible.

Admin Dashboard
Library staff manage books, issue physical books to members, process returns, fulfil holds, and moderate reviews.

Member Management
Admins can view and update the status of member accounts, including Active, Inactive, or Suspended.

Super Admin Controls
The Super Admin can add, upgrade, downgrade, and delete librarian accounts, providing complete control over user management.

Automated Background Jobs
Node-cron automatically processes expired e-book loans and unfulfilled holds every night at 3:00 AM without manual intervention.
